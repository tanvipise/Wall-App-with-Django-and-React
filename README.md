# Wall-App-with-Django-and-React

Wall App is an application that allows users to register, login, and write on a wall.

-> Registration and Login: Anonymous users can create a new user and this new user receives a welcome email. New users can then log in.
-> Wall (authed):  After logging in, a user can post messages on the site-wide wall, similar to a facebook wall except there is only 1 wall for the entire site.  
-> Wall (guest): Guests as well as authed users can see all of the messages on the wall.
-> Write automated tests to confirm the functionality of the above requirements

Backend: REST API (Django with Django REST Framework)
Frontend: React
